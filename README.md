## Notes 

- Due to the integration of the user related features and our authentication solution, this assignment 2 submission application contains authentication features (but no authorization features) as per the concession by the CS3219 teaching team. Thus to use the PeerPrep application, a user must login with their Google account, at which point they will be prompted to create a user profile in our system if it is the first time they are logging in. After creation of their account, they can access the rest of the website (if not they will be redirected back to the user profile creation page).
