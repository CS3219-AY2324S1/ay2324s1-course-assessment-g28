## Notes 

- Authentication is done through Google OAuth. Thus you will need a Google account to sign into PeerPrep. After logging in for the first time with your Google account, you will be prompted to create your user profile. Once created, you will be redirected to the authenticated homepage. If you do not create a user account after logging in for the first time, you will continually be redirected to the user profile creation page until you do.
- Follow the instructions in the [user service README.md](backend/services/user/README.md) to make the user account associated with your Google email address an administrator.
